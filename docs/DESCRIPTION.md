Waste generation is a trend that keeps increasing over the years and is something we cannot avoid. According to EPA US, the total generation of municipal solid waste (MSW) in 2018 was 292.4 million tons (U.S. short tons, unless specified) or 4.9 pounds per person per day. Some of these waste are not only harmful to the environment but when left untreated and exposed cause serious diseases to animals and human beings.
Talking about recent times, the amount of infectious or biomedical waste accumulated has increased metronomically by 121 % since the pandemic hit. Keeping in mind, this data is apart from the waste accumulated from Covid patients treated under home isolation.
This is a matter of serious concern to be taken care of right from the the point of generation of these wastes, that is from our homes. We need to be aware on how to treat this waste and how to dispose them in ways that our environment stays unaffected or least affected.

#### Problem Statement : 

The problem can be handled by making people aware about how to dispose the particular type of waste in appropriate way. There are several categories of waste that follow different ways of disposal such as follows:

- Food Waste, accumulated from home can be treated using methods of composting, food donation when excess foodstuffs are still safe to eat, they can can be given to the hungry and the poor.
- Packaging wastes, as the amount of online shopping has increased with stores closed, this has also increased the carbon footprint by generating a lot of paper, plastic and packaging material.
- Hazardous Waste, such as acids, paint, pesticides etc. Improper disposal of these can include pouring them down the drain, on the ground, into storm sewers, or in some cases putting them out with the regular trash.
- Clothes, waste has increased over time which can be up cycled by donating or giving to thrift stores that would resell used clothes that can still be reused. 
- E-waste, Electronic equipment like televisions, computers, monitors and printers contain dangerous but recyclable materials. These waste can be disposed to e-waste collection centre
- Recyclable waste, like plastic, paper, glass, metal, batteries and light bulbs, electronics, compost, etc. can be composted or reused in many different ways and are easily collected by Municipal waste collectors.
- Biomedical Waste is generated during the diagnosis, treatment or immunization of human beings or animals or in research activities pertaining thereto or in the production. 

#### Solution

The application would  provide following features to promote safe disposal and healthy environment.

#### Features

- Document Guides of approved ways of disposal from WHO
- Waste cost calculator that takes market price that specific vendors use to buy wastes and generated an approximate cost that encourages people to sell their wastes to certified recyclers.
- Municipal Waste collectors contact number, location, days of working etc.
- Donation center details for Food, clothes, E-waste
- Recycling and Upcycling guides to promote recycle and reuse
- Chatbot for help of any queries.
- Notification for nearby Donation camps to encourage people to donate.

#### Technology stack: 

- The app is build on Reactjs using Nextjs framework and carbon components.
- The app is deployed on Kubernetes using IBM Cloud Container Registry services.
- Watson Discovery is used to crawl through major web sites and provide relevant information. Additionally, it is used to calculate market value of different types of waste items. This predicts approximate costs of selling waste items and encourages users to sell wastes.
- Watson Assistant for quick guidance and to answer quick doubts.
- Twilio for integrating push notifications, reminders for donations happening nearby.
