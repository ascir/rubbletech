          <AccordionItem title="What is Hazardous waste">
            <p>
              Hazardous waste is waste with properties that make it dangerous or capable of having a harmful effect on human health or the environment.
            </p>
          </AccordionItem>
          <AccordionItem title="How to dispose">
            <p>
              Hazardous waste can be treated by chemical, thermal, biological, and physical methods. Chemical methods include ion exchange, precipitation, oxidation and reduction, and neutralization. Among thermal methods is high-temperature incineration, which not only can detoxify certain organic wastes but also can destroy them.
